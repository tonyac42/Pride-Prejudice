          <li>"A single man in possession of a great fortune must be in want of a wife."</li>
          <li>"A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."</li>
          <li>"There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me."</li>
          <li>"I have not the pleasure of understanding you."</li>
          <li>"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. My affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."</li>
